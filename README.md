# Nkem | Entrepreneur, SaaS & Automation Builder

Hi, I am Nkem. I build practical software and consulting solutions that sit at the intersection of:
- SaaS for SMEs  
- Automation and AI assisted workflows  
- Climate, risk, and disaster management for governments and local councils  

I work across multiple ventures that reinforce one another, combining hands on product building with policy and strategy work.

## What I am building

### WeorcOS (under Growthify Limited, UK)
AI enabled business operating system for UK SMEs, focused on:

- **Intelligent simplicity**  
  Clear, non intimidating UX for SME owners who are not tech specialists.

- **Invisible complexity**  
  The heavy lifting happens in the background: data flows, automation, compliance, and integrations.

Key pillars in the WeorcOS vision:
- Central performance hub for SME operations  
- Light finance and cash flow tooling, with integrations to existing accounting systems  
- Process mapping and workflow automation that do not overwhelm non technical users  
- CRM, customer support, and communication features aligned with how SMEs actually work (mobile first, social and messaging heavy)  
- Security and resilience baked in from the start using modern cloud tooling

Tech ecosystem I am using or planning for WeorcOS:
- Python for automation and backend utilities  
- JavaScript and modern frontend tooling (via VS Code and GitHub)  
- Supabase for auth and data  
- n8n for orchestration and automation  
- Cloudflare and Vercel for deployment, performance, and security  
- GitHub Codespaces and Copilot to accelerate development  
- Google AI Studio for faster prototyping and internal tools

### Growthify Limited
Growthify is the umbrella for building software and tools that:
- Improve SME effectiveness, efficiency, and decision making  
- Provide practical, implementation focused support for local councils on climate risk and disaster management  
- Bridge the gap between strategic consulting and usable products

### Agogo Consulting Limited
Advisory work focused on:
- Decarbonisation of infrastructure in Nigeria  
- Disaster risk reduction and hydrological risk  
- Climate related policy and program design for public sector and development partners  

I actively look for ways to turn consulting insights into repeatable tools, playbooks, and software components.

### Other initiatives
- **African Junction**  
  Retail and export venture focused on African food products into the UK, with a strong interest in data driven inventory, logistics, and margin management.

- **Local Resilience Lab (UK)**  
  Concept work on helping local councils translate climate and disaster risk frameworks into practical, locally adapted tools and processes.

## How I think and work

- **Systems and processes first**  
  I like clear architectures, process maps, and operating models that show how everything fits together.

- **Product plus policy**  
  I move between strategic work for public sector and very concrete SaaS product decisions, and design them to inform each other.

- **Lean but serious**  
  I work as a lean founder, but aim for investor grade, regulator aware, and enterprise ready thinking in documents, models, and app design.

- **Automation as leverage**  
  If a process will repeat, I look for how to encode it with Python, low code tools like n8n, or tightly scoped AI.

## Current technical focus

I am actively improving my skills around:

- Python for scripting, automation, and backend prototypes  
- JavaScript and modern web development in VS Code  
- Git, GitHub, and Codespaces for structured development workflows  
- Supabase, PostgreSQL, and data modelling for SaaS backends  
- Cloudflare and related tools for security, routing, and performance  
- AI assisted tooling (Google AI Studio, Copilot, and others) to speed up design and implementation

## What you will find here

Over time, this GitHub profile will host:

- WeorcOS related repos  
  - MVP and subsequent iterations  
  - Internal tools (CRM, support, finance lite, process mapping, automation)  
- Growthify and Local Resilience Lab prototypes and utilities  
- Small Python tools for automation, data handling, and experimentation  
- Documentation, prompts, and playbooks that sit behind the products

I am building in public in a deliberate way, so early code may prioritise learning and speed, then progressively harden toward production quality.
