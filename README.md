# Nkem | Python Developer, Scrum Master, Business Analyst & Product Owner

I design and ship B2B SaaS products for SMEs and public-sector teams, working end-to-end as:

- Scaled Agile Scrum Master  
- Business Analyst  
- Product Owner  
- Founder / Operator  

I care about **intelligent simplicity** for users and **well-structured complexity** under the hood.

---

## What I do

- Lead discovery and requirements: clarify goals, constraints, and success metrics  
- Translate business needs into product strategy, roadmaps, and user stories  
- Run Agile delivery (Scrum / Scaled Agile) across cross-functional teams  
- Design and iterate SaaS workflows around real-world usage, not slideware  
- Use automation and AI tools to reduce manual, repetitive work

Domains I work in:

- SME-focused B2B SaaS (operations, finance-lite, and performance tooling)  
- Automation and orchestration of business workflows  
- Risk, resilience, and performance management for organisations

## Current stack & tools

- **Languages & Dev:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Git, GitHub, VS Code, Codespaces  
- **Cloud & Data:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, modern cloud hosting  
- **Automation:** n8n and related workflow tools  
- **AI-assisted build:** GitHub Copilot, prompt-driven internal tools

On GitHub, you’ll mostly find:

- Experiments and MVPs for B2B SaaS ideas  
- Internal tools for automation, analytics, and operations  
- Utilities that encode repeatable processes from my product and consulting work
